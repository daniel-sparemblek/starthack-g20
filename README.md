## Project Forestify: Revolutionizing Wildfire Management in Brazil

### 1. Introduction
    

Forestify is an innovative platform designed to revolutionize wildfire prevention and management in Brazil. By leveraging the power of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), drones, and satellite technology, Forestify offers a comprehensive, integrated solution to mitigate wildfires' economic and environmental impacts, offering a mechanism for early wildfire detection.

-   Motivation: This solution is a part of the case provided by G20 Global Land Initiative in cooperation with Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya which proposed a mission to come up with Tackling Wildfire Land degradation in Brazil.
    

The case provided consisted of the three following pillars:

1.  Enhance wildfire detection in Brazil using a deep-learning model
    
2.  Develop a platform that helps understand the extent of land degradation in Brazil using various datasets.
    
3.  Pitch innovative Visualization solution for Land restoration to Brazilian Government representatives.
    

### 2. Features

-   For the first part of the project to improve the deep-learning model for wildfire detection in Brazil, our team used a combination of different data sets from various sources including wildfire image datasets we found on different research papers to improve and test the improved architecture of our deep-learning model.
    

Dynamic Dashboard

-   User-Friendly Interface: Additionally we have made a prototype of a user-friendly dashboard specifically tailored for the firefighting department administrators, enabling quick access between the GIS data analysis and soil-moisture sensor data for easy navigation and early detection.
    
-   Real-Time Data Visualization: Integrates data from various sources like soil moisture sensors, satellite imagery, and UAVs to provide a macroscopic view of forest health and micro-level data on dry regions.

### 5. References and Research Literature
We investigated the problem thoroughly and thanks to depth-through research papers, we were able to obtain a more profound understanding of the problem, potential solutions and limitations, therefore, we want to reference those papers for further investigation into the problem.
